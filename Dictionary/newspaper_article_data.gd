According to the two, Stephany stayed home to enjoy a cozy evening by herself, and had no visitors planned. Despite all this, the gruesome crime scene indicates no signs of forced entry. The young lady of 22 of age was violently stabbed multiple time in her torso and neck area, confirms the law enforcement present on the crime scene. 
		
		As per tradition, the crime was completed with a message covered in the victim's blood. It reads the bloody sentence 'THANKS FOR NOT OPENING THE LIGHT'. It is believed those words were adressed to the roommates, who may have failed to witness the killer. Cruel message, or sick joke?",
